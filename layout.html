        <h1>Mistborn: The Final Empire</h1>
        <p>Mistborn is a series of epic fantasy novels written by
            American author Brandon Sanderson and published by Tor 
            Books. The first trilogy, published between 2006 and
            2008, consists of The Final Empire, The Well of 
            Ascension, and The Hero of Ages. A second series
            was released between 2011 and 2022, and consists
            of The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands
            of Mourning and The Lost Metal. A third series
            will follow them, which is likely to be 
            released yearly from 2025 to 2027.
            A fourth trilogy is also planned.
            Sanderson also released a novella
            in 2016, Mistborn: Secret History.</p>

        <h1>
            Development
        </h1>
        <p>
            Sanderson's first idea for Mistborn came while 
            reading the Harry Potter series: He thought it would 
            be interesting to set a story in a world where the 
            "dark lord" triumphed and the "prophesied hero" failed
            His second idea, originally unrelated, was to tell a 
            heist story in a fantasy setting, an idea inspired by
             the Ocean's film series. The idea for the titular mist
              came while he was driving through mist in Idaho, which 
              combined with his memories of having once seen Washington 
              National Cathedral lit from the inside. He originally 
              developed feruchemy and allomancy for separate stories 
              before deciding to bring them together in one story.

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Vin:</li> A teenage street urchin who discovers that she is a Mistborn and joins Kelsier's crew. She is wary and not trusting, having lived a harsh life on the streets. She is haunted by the memory of her brother Reen, who frequently beat her and taught her brutal lessons of survival.
            <li>Kelsier:</li> A famous thief who made a fortune stealing from the nobility. He and his wife were eventually caught and sent to the Pits of Hathsin, a notorious prison camp from which no one has ever returned. There, Kelsier witnessed his wife's death, which awakened his Mistborn powers and allowed him to escape. He inherits his wife's dream of overthrowing the Final Empire, and now leads a rebellion to accomplish this goal.
            <li>Ruler:</li>  The immortal ruler and self-proclaimed god of the Final Empire, who is said to have saved mankind a thousand years ago and remade the world into its current form.
           <li>Sazed:</li>  A Terrisman Keeper who can use the ancient art of Feruchemy, which allows him to store attributes such as physical strength, time, and even knowledge in metal. He hopes to one day share knowledge of the past (especially regarding various religions that once existed) with all people when the Final Empire has been overthrown.
            <Li>Elend Venture:</Li> A nobleman and the heir to House Venture, the most powerful house in Luthadel. He is one of the few nobles who wishes for societal reform in the Final Empire. He often breaks from traditional noble cultural standards, and quickly grows close to Vin as she infiltrates high society posing as Valette Renoux.
           <li>Breeze:</li>  A member of Kelsier's crew and a Soother – someone who can soothe and manipulate people's emotions by burning brass. He enjoys using his abilities to manipulate people into fetching him wine. His main task is recruiting skaa for Kelsier's army.
            <li>Hammond:</li> One of Kelsier's crewmembers, also known as Ham. He is a Thug, or Pewterarm, who burns pewter to enhance his physical abilities. He likes to hold philosophical debates, especially with Breeze, unlike a stereotypical Pewterarm. His main task is training “an army” at the hidden caves for Kelsier's plan.
             One of Kelsier's crewmembers, and Kelsier's oldest friend. Unlike the others, he does not have any Allomantic powers. Instead he is responsible for organizing the crew and taking care of contacting other crews for help.
            <li>Spook:</li>  A member of Kelsier's crew and Clubs' nephew. The name "Spook" is given to him by Kelsier after he finds Lestibournes too difficult to pronounce. He is a Tineye (a Misting who burns tin to enhance their senses) and the youngest member of the crew. He often speaks in a type of street-slang the others find difficult to understand.
            <li>Clubs:</li> A member of Kelsier's crew and Spooks’ uncle. Clubs is a carpenter and a Smoker (a Misting who burns copper to hide the use of Allomancy from other Allomancers). He owns a shop that serves as a secret base of operations for Kelsier and his crew. He is also called Master Cladent.
             Kelsier's estranged brother, a former member of the skaa rebellion who has lost hope of overthrowing the Final Empire. He is a Seeker, an Allomancer who can detect other Allomancers. Kelsier encourages Marsh to rejoin the rebellion and aid them by infiltrating the Canton of Inquisition.
            <li>Lord Renoux:</li> A nobleman who supports the plot to overthrow the Empire. Kelsier subtly implies that he may be an imposter.
             a representative of the skaa rebellion who seeks Kelsier's aid in acquiring an army
