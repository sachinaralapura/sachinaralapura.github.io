                Adolf Hitler ( 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945)
                was an Austrian-born German politician who
                was dictator of Germany from 1933 until his
                death in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of
                the Nazi Party,[a] becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then
                taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler
                in 1934.[b] During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II
                in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September
                1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout
                the war and was central
                perpetration of the Holocaust,
                the genocide of about six million Jews and millions
                of other victims. <span id="more">Hitler was born in Braunau
                    am Inn in Austria-Hungary and was raised near Linz. He lived
                    in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved
                    to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in
                    the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the
                    German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi
                    Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921.
                    In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a
                    failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of
                    five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his
                    autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ("My
                    Struggle"). After his earl
                    release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking
                    the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism,
                    anti-Semitism
                    and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi
                    propaganda.
                    He frequently denonced international capitalism
                    and communism as art of a Jewish
                    conspiracy.</span>
